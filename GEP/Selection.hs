-- Routines for selection after fitness evaluation.  Selection is the process
-- of taking some input population P, a set of fitness values such that
-- each p in P has a fitness score f(p,X) under some fitness test X, and
-- selecting which members of P participate in the creation of the next
-- population P'.
--
-- A common technique is roulette wheel selection.  In essence, this means that
-- we create a roulette wheel with one slot per individual where the width of
-- each slot is a function of the fitness of the individuals.  So, those
-- individuals with very good fitness will have wide slots and a correspondingly
-- high likelihood of selection, while poor fitness individuals will have tiny
-- slots and a low probability of being selected.
--
-- Fitness testing takes place outside this module.  This module is only
-- concerned with the selection process (ie: generating the roulette wheel).

  We may return nothing if an empty set is passed in to begin with, so
  the return type is a Maybe pair.

  Generate n roulette weights with a generator exponent e.  A helper function
  weight_function is used to generate the actual weights.  For example,
  w = (k^e)^(-1) for k from 1 to n leads to a set of weights such that the
  size of the slots decreases exponentially as fitness decreases.  When e=1,
  this decrease is linear.  The list that is returned is the width of each slot
  such that the total of the weights adds to 1.0.

  Given a set of roulette weights and a number of spins of the wheel, return
  a list of indices corresponding to the winning slot for each spin.  This
  is used to perform the actual selection after a set of roulette weights are
  generated.
