TODO

When reading floating point values from csv file (Prelude.read "1." :: Double)
returns "no parse". Not sure about whether "1." forms a valid string for a
floating point number, but this should be corrected anyway. E.g. Mathematica
string of N[1] is "1.".
Until then try "sed -i 's%\.\([^0-9]\|$\)%.0\1%g'"


can maxfitness parameter be computed based on input size of test data set?

make generic driver that can be used by specific applications to build the
main for the program.

support for constants

test multigenic chromosomes

move arity test stuff into genome and make it part of the param spec file

test code for emitting graphviz of trees

more regression example test files

implement another example (ie: something based on logic?)

concurrent fitness evaluation

write HOWTO for new examples

quickcheck / hunit

properly haddockize things -- current docs are a mish-mash, not sure if 
proper cross linking is performed.

integrate chart plotting for fitness

properly monadify the random number generation
